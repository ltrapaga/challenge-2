# Advanced CSS: Professional Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation when completing this project was to put into practice and become more proficient in the concepts I learned throughout Module 2: Advanced CSS of Bootcamp.
- I built this project to practice applying what I have learned in class about flexbox, media queries, and advanced CSS to a real web application. Creating my own web developer portfolio from scratch allowed me to gain the necessary skills for effectively using advanced CSS.
- During the completion of this project, I learned how to properly use flexbox, media queries, variables, and more, to increase the functionality of a web application.
